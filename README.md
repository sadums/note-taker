# Note Taker

## Description

This is a note-taking application that allows users to create, save, and view notes. The application has a simple and intuitive interface that makes it easy for users to create and manage and save their notes through an express.js server.

## Usage

1. Upon opening the Note Taker, the user is presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page.
2. When the user clicks on the link to the notes page, they are presented with a page that displays existing notes in the left-hand column and empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column.
3. When the user enters a new note title and the note’s text, a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page.
4. When the user clicks on the Save icon, the new note is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes.
5. When the user clicks on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column, that note appears in the right-hand column.
6. When the user clicks on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page, they are presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column.
